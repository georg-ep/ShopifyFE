      <div>Online Returns Policy</div>

      Please be sure to send us your item(s) back in full accordance with our
      Return Policy: Items must be sent back within 30 days of the delivery
      date. Items must be unworn, unwashed, and have original tags attached.
      Items must be free of stains, makeup, deodorant, or wear. All returns must
      include an order packing slip that clearly indicates which items are being
      returned. If this is not filled out correctly, your return may experience
      issues in processing. When sending back items from multiple orders, you
      must fill out an order packing slip for each applicable order. We are not
      liable for any return packages that may become lost or stolen in-transit.
      Please keep your proof of postage and/or return tracking number when
      shipping back your returns. Returns are processed within 5-7 business days
      after your item(s) are delivered to us. Damaged, defective, or incorrect
      items must be reported within 7 days of delivery. Returned-to-Sender &
      Refused Packages This can happen if (1) an address is invalid or missing
      information, (2) the carrier is unable to deliver your package, or (3) the
      order is refused by the customer at time of delivery. We are unable to
      make changes to orders once they have been placed in our system. To ensure
      that your package is properly delivered, make sure that your address is
      entered correctly and includes all relevant information. The use of
      correct abbreviations, street numbers, building or apartment numbers, and
      route information (if applicable) are critical to ensuring delivery. We do
      not take responsibility for lost, misplaced, or incorrectly delivered
      shipments if the address information provided is incorrect at the time of
      purchase. Damaged/Defective/Incorrect Items Should you receive a damaged,
      defective, or incorrect item, contact our Customer Care team on our
      "Contact Us" page. Once we receive your request, we will be in contact
      with you to address and resolve the issue. Depending on the shipping
      method and carrier selected, your return package may take several weeks to
      reach us if returning from an international location. Please allow 5-7
      business days to process your return once it is delivered to our
      Distribution Center. Once your return is fully processed, we will issue
      you the refund. Helpful Hint: We are not responsible for returns until
      they reach our warehouse. Keep your proof of postage and ship your return
      along with a tracking number as we are not liable for return packages that
      are lost or stolen in-transit. Without proof of receipt and delivery.
      Please go to our "Contact Us" page if you have any addition questions
      related to returns and we will happily help you!
